A version of Peg Solitaire programmed in Go and played using a browser.

# Playing Instructions
This is a very old version of solitaire. The goal of this game is to remove all stones but one. 
Stones are removed when a neighoring stone jumps across them onto a free field. Here, the stones that can be removed are highlighted in yellow and marked with one or two arrows that mark the possible direction of a stone.
If there are two possible jumps across one stone, just click on that stone and select a direction using the two buttons that appear to the right of the field.

Moves are recorded in a history field. The entry shows the number of the move, the field (columns: A-G, rows: 1:7), and the direction (H: horizontal, V: vertical).

You can undo the last move by pressing undo, and you can rewind to an earlier move by clicking on the move in the history. Remember that you may have to scroll down.</p>
